<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This crispy, gooey, spicy, and utterly indulgent comfort food requires just a few things: a strong, sharp cheddar to play off the tangy kimchi (make your own if you’re feeling ambitious!); the patience to let the cheese fully melt over moderate heat; and, most importantly, a fast and confident flip. Consider any crispy shards of cheese that get stuck to the pan the chef’s treat.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 ½"-thick slices Pullman or other white sandwich bread, divided</li>
<li>3

    Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, divided</li>
    <li>4

        tsp. gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) or Sriracha, divided</li>
        <li>1½

            cups coarsely grated sharp cheddar, divided</li>
            <li>½

                cup drained coarsely chopped kimchi, divided</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place 2 bread slices on a work surface. Evenly spread ½ Tbsp. butter over each slice. Turn 1 slice over and spread 2 tsp. gochujang over, then top with ½ cup cheese and half the kimchi. Close sandwich with buttered sides facing out. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp. cheese over top of sandwich, gently pressing to adhere cheese to butter.</li>
    <li>Heat ½ Tbsp. butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low until foaming. Cook sandwich, cheese side down (if some cheese falls out, use a heatproof spatula to nudge it back underneath the sandwich), gently pressing occasionally with a heatproof spatula, until underside is golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle another 2 Tbsp. cheese over top of sandwich, pressing with spatula to adhere. Turn sandwich over and cook until golden brown on second side and cheese inside is fully melted, about 3 minutes. Transfer sandwich to a plate. Wipe out skillet and repeat process with remaining ingredients to make 1 more sandwich.</li>
